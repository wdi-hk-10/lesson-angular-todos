# Angular JS Example - Simple Todo List

This is a very simple implementation of a Todo application using basic Angular directives. 

You can further expand this to add more functionalities such as:
- To mark a task as completed
- List only uncompleted tasks
- List only completed tasks
- Remove completed tasks
- Do not add empty tasks

## How to use

- If you just plan to run the code locally, just `git clone` to your local.
- If you plan to make some changes to the code, `fork` and then `git clone` this to your local.
- To install the dependency, run `bower install --save`.
